                  Like an architect designing a building, we start with the
                  blueprint. We map your processes, identify the highest-impact
                  opportunities, and design systems that grow with your business.

                  Logging, monitoring, error handlingâ€”not as an afterthought,
                  but as core architectural decisions. Because what you can't
                  see, you can't improve.
